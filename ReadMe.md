## Introduction

The Suicide Prevention and Monitoring using AI project aims to leverage artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques to provide support and monitoring for individuals who may be at risk of self-harm or suicide. The system analyzes user-generated text to identify signs of distress and alert appropriate authorities or support networks.
